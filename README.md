## Compiling Python FNF

This is a step by step to compile the repository.

Follow these steps to compile Python FNF:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install Git if you haven't already.


> [!NOTE]
> If you've already cloned the `python-fnf` repository, skip to Step 3.

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/NAEL2XD/python-fnf.git`
2. When it's fully cloned, go inside `python-fnf` folder.
3. Open a terminal in the `python-fnf` folder.
4. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
5. Wait until it's done.
6. Close the terminal.
7. Double click on `compile.bat`.
8. It should start compiling, when it's done compiling you should see `export` and `build`
9. Open `export` and you've successfully built Python FNF!

> [!NOTE]
> Tip: This workflow is especially recommended for Python developers who want to debug or test changes incrementally.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to test your changes without compiling, you can run:
> `python Compile.py`

This allows you to preview your modifications before building the project.
